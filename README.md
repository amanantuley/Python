## üìù **About the Repository**  

This repository features the **Smart Traffic Signal** project, which aims to optimize traffic flow using Python. The project showcases:  
- The application of Python for real-time decision-making.  
- The use of sensors or simulation for traffic monitoring.  
- Implementation of algorithms to dynamically adjust signal timings based on traffic density.

## üìÇ **Project Description**  

### **Smart Traffic Signal**  
- A Python-based application designed to optimize traffic signals at intersections.  
- Uses real-time or simulated data from cameras or sensors to analyze traffic density.  
- Dynamically adjusts the signal timings to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.  

#### Key Features:  
1. **Dynamic Signal Timing**: Automatically adjusts green light durations based on real-time traffic conditions.  
2. **Traffic Monitoring**: Simulates or integrates with sensors to count the number of vehicles.  
3. **Efficient Algorithm**: Implements queue management and prioritization for smoother traffic flow.  
4. **Scalability**: Can be extended to multiple intersections for city-wide traffic management.

## üíª **Technologies Used**  

- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `OpenCV`: For image processing and vehicle detection (if cameras are used).  
  - `time`: For simulating signal timing.  
  - `tkinter` or `PyQt`: For creating a GUI (if applicable).
